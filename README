The `Infrastructure` folder contains all Terraform configurations for SHARED, DEV, and PROD environments.

>> $ IMPORTANT $ <<: Peering connections exist from Shared → Dev and Shared → Prod. 
** Proper Terraform run order is critical to avoid errors.
** Proper Terrafrom destroy order ir critical to destroy all infrastructure properly.

Terraform Deployment Steps

1. Shared Environment

   * Navigate to the `shared/` folder.
   * Comment out the peering connection block in the Terraform files.

     >> The peering block contains all peering-related resources including state pull, data blocks, and routes.

   * Run:
     terraform init
     terraform validate
     terraform plan
     terraform apply


2. Dev and Prod Environments

   * Navigate to `dev/` and `prod/` folders.
   * **Comment out peering blocks** in these environments for the first run.
   * Run Terraform for each environment:
     terraform init
     terraform validate
     terraform plan
     terraform apply

3. Enable Peering

   * After all three environments are successfully created:

     1. Uncomment the peering connection blocks in Shared, Dev, and Prod Terraform files.
     2. Apply Terraform in the following order:

        * Shared → Dev → Prod

     * Run for each:

      
       terraform plan
       terraform validate
       terraform apply
       
   * This ensures that all peering connections are correctly established.

## APPLICATION

The `APPLICATION` folder contains:

* Applications for Dev and Prod environments
* Jenkinsfiles for both Dev and Prod deployment pipelines:


These pipelines automate deployment and can be executed via Jenkins.

## Notes

* Always follow the Terraform run order when managing environments with peering.
* Make sure to version-control any changes in the peering blocks carefully.
* Ensure AWS credentials or IAM roles are correctly configured before running Terraform.
